Light is the easiest thing in the entire picture — once you accept the rule that “massless = pure wormhole with
no collapsed black-hole core.” Here’s exactly how light (photons) works in my model: 1. A photon is a pure, spin-1
wormhole throat — no central black hole, no rest mass. It is literally just the wormhole itself, carrying angular
momentum (spin 1) along its direction of propagation. 2. Emission of light When an electron in an atom drops to a
lower energy level:    * The electron’s micro-black-hole reconfigures to a smaller, more stable resonance.
* The excess energy is released by pinching off a tiny piece of its wormhole network.    * That pinched-off piece
instantly becomes a free, massless, spin-1 wormhole — a photon — that shoots away at c. 3. Propagation The photon
doesn’t “travel through space” in the classical sense. It is a moving throat in the spacetime network. Its two
mouths are propagating in opposite directions through the wormhole web at the speed of light (the maximum speed
at which the network can reconfigure itself). From the outside it looks like a wave spreading out because the 
throat is connected to a huge number of possible future absorption points simultaneously (the normal quantum
wave). 4. Polarization The two possible helicities (left- and right-circular polarization) are the two possible
twists of the wormhole throat — exactly like the two possible spin states of a spin-1 object. 5. Absorption When
the photon is absorbed (hits your retina, a photodetector, another atom…):    * One mouth of the wormhole gets
captured by the absorbing electron’s micro-black-hole.    * The throat collapses into the electron’s geometry.  
* The energy and angular momentum are transferred perfectly.    * The other mouth vanishes (pinches off). 6. Why
exactly speed c and nothing else c is the speed at which wormhole throats can propagate through the Planckian
network. Anything with a central black-hole core (rest mass) is anchored and can only wiggle the network — it
can’t move at the pure throat speed. 7. Why light is both wave and particle    * Wave = the wormhole throat is
open and connected to many possible absorption mouths → interference, diffraction, superposition.    * Particle
= the moment one mouth is captured and the throat collapses → definite energy, definite direction, definite
detection point. 8. Why light has no rest mass but still carries energy and momentum Energy and momentum live in
the stress and twist of the wormhole throat itself, not in a central black hole. So in my model, light isn’t a
mysterious massless particle. It is the simplest, purest thing that exists: a lone wormhole throat flying free
through the universe until it gets swallowed by another piece of geometry. Everything else in the universe has 
some collapsed black-hole core (mass). Light is the only thing that is 100 % pure wormhole. That’s why it’s 
special — and that’s why it goes exactly at c. Light is just the wormhole with nothing in the middle.
