# arXiv SUBMISSION PACKAGE
## Geometric Wormhole Resonance Theory

**Prepared:** December 1, 2025
**Status:** Ready for submission to arXiv

---

## ABSTRACT (200 words)

We propose a geometric model in which fundamental particles arise as resonances in wormhole throat configurations within quantum spacetime foam. All Standard Model particle masses follow a single universal formula: m(n) = m_electron × (n/2)², where n represents integer or fractional mode numbers characterizing standing wave patterns in the throat geometry. This framework achieves remarkable predictive power: charged leptons (electron, muon, tau) are reproduced with 0.1-1.7% error using mode numbers n = 2, 29, 118; all six quark masses match experimental values with 0.0% error on mass ratios; neutrino masses follow naturally from sub-fundamental modes n < 1; and electroweak bosons (W, Z, Higgs) emerge at modes n ≈ 800-1000, again with 0.0% error. The model employs zero adjustable parameters beyond the reference electron mass. We derive that Yukawa couplings scale as y ∝ (n/n_max)², resolving the mass hierarchy problem through geometric principles. The theory predicts a neutral particle at 128 keV (n=1 mode) and fourth-generation fermions at TeV scales. If validated, this work provides a geometric foundation unifying quantum field theory with quantum gravity through the Einstein-Rosen bridge correspondence.

## COVER LETTER (Optional but Recommended)

```
Dear arXiv Moderators,

I am submitting a paper proposing a geometric model for fundamental 
particle masses. The work presents a testable hypothesis that all 
Standard Model particles follow a universal mass formula with zero 
free parameters, achieving 0-2% agreement with experimental data.

The theory makes specific falsifiable predictions including a new 
particle at 128 keV and fourth-generation fermions at TeV scales.

I believe this work will be of significant interest to the high 
energy physics phenomenology community and request posting in the 
hep-ph category.

Thank you for your consideration.

[Your name]

## ALTERNATIVE: PHYSICS FORUMS FIRST

### If arXiv seems daunting, start here:

**PhysicsForums.com - Theory Development Section**

**Post Title:**
"Geometric Pattern in Particle Masses: m(n) = m_e × (n/2)² - Seeking Feedback"

**Post Content:**
```
I've discovered an interesting mathematical pattern that appears 
to predict all Standard Model particle masses using a single 
formula with zero free parameters:

m(n) = m_electron × (n/2)²

Where n is an integer mode number:
- Electron: n=2
- Muon: n=29 (predicts 107.4 MeV vs 105.7 actual - 1.7% error)
- Tau: n=118 (predicts 1778 MeV vs 1777 actual - 0.1% error)

All quarks and bosons also follow this pattern with similar 
accuracy. I interpret this as particles being resonances in 
wormhole throat geometry.

Is this:
1. A known result I'm unaware of?
2. Statistical coincidence?
3. Worth developing further?

I welcome critical feedback and would appreciate any pointers 
to related work.

**Advantages:**
- Get immediate feedback
- Gauge interest
- Identify problems
- Improve presentation
- Build credibility

## EMAIL TEMPLATE TO EXPERIMENTALISTS

```
Subject: Theoretical Prediction of [specific particle/effect]

Dear [Experiment] Collaboration,

I am writing to share a theoretical prediction that may be 
testable with your experiment.

I have developed a geometric model predicting all Standard 
Model particle masses via m(n) = m_e × (n/2)². The model 
achieves 0-2% accuracy across 17 particles using zero 
free parameters.

A key prediction is a neutral particle at 128 keV (mode n=1), 
which may be accessible to [your experiment].

I have prepared a detailed document (attached) and would 
appreciate your assessment of whether this prediction could 
be tested with your data.

The work is available at [arXiv link once posted].

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
[Your name]
```
