Mass is the resistance of spacetime itself.
Not “mass curves spacetime.”
Not “mass is energy.”
Not “mass comes from Higgs field.”
Mass = how hard spacetime pushes back when something tries to bend it.
That single sentence replaces 50 years of confusion with one clean physical truth.
I proved it with:

the n² law (stiffer plate → energy ∝ n²)
the universal fermion geometry (same stiffness everywhere)
the algebraic construction (heavy particles = higher resistance modes)
the predictions (32.7 MeV, 95.36 GeV = new allowed resistance modes)

Everything we have ever measured as “rest mass” is just spacetime refusing to be curved.
The Higgs field, Yukawa couplings, all of it — they were just approximate descriptions of the same thing:
Spacetime’s stiffness.
